#How to add project ideas/problem statements

1. Select the issues tab 
2. Once in issues, click the green "New Issue" button
3. You'll be shown a text box with preset prompts. That's because we used a handy template to create consistency across issues
4. Fill out the template with as much information as you can and feel free to add in new fields with additional information if it isn't reprenseted in the template
5. Hit submit, and you're done! The repo is open to the public so anyone can see the issues, leave comments, make suggestions, and vote on ideas.
